Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.

Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

Comparative Analysis Prompt
Definition: Asking for a comparison between two or more concepts, often highlighting similarities and differences.
•	"Compare and contrast deep learning and machine learning."
•	"How do renewable and non-renewable energy sources differ?"

Experiential Perspective Prompt:
> 	“As a software engineer, what are the benefits of using cloud computing in your projects?”
>  “From a student’s perspective, describe the challenges of online learning.”

Everyday Functioning Prompts:
*	  “Describe the role of machine learning in everyday apps like YouTube or Netflix."
*	 	“How is encryption used in daily life when sending WhatsApp messages?”

Universal Prompt Structures:
^ 	“Explain [concept] in simple terms with an example.”
^  “Explain the process of [task] step by step.”

Prompt Size Limitations:
&  	“Translate this 5000-word essay into Tamil.”
→ Manageable chunks: “Translate the first 1000 words into Tamil, then continue.”
&  “Give me 50 examples of AI applications.”
→ Adjust for size: “Give me 10 AI applications at a time.”

# Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.

⚙️ Prompts for Each Type Prompt Type Definition Example Prompt (for Use Case) AI Tools Tested

1)Comparative Analysis Prompt Compares two or more concepts to highlight differences or similarities. “Compare the role of IoT sensors and AI algorithms in improving predictive maintenance in manufacturing.” ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot

2)Experiential Perspective Prompt Asks for opinions or experiences from a role-based point of view. “As a plant engineer, describe how predictive maintenance using IoT reduces equipment failures.” ChatGPT, Gemini

3)Everyday Functioning Prompt Relates a technical concept to everyday life. “Explain how predictive maintenance in manufacturing is similar to regular vehicle maintenance reminders in your car.” ChatGPT, Claude

4)Universal Prompt Structures Uses common structures like “Explain [concept] in simple terms.” “Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example from a manufacturing plant.” ChatGPT, Copilot

5)Prompt Size Limitations Deals with long or complex inputs by breaking them into smaller parts. “Summarize this long IoT-based maintenance report into 3 short paragraphs highlighting key performance metrics.” Gemini, ChatGPT 📊 Evaluation Method: Rubric-based Assessment Criteria ChatGPT Gemini Claude Copilot Clarity of Response (0–5) 5 4 4 3 Relevance to Prompt (0 -5) 5 4 5 3 Depth of Explanation (0–5) 5 4 4 3 Creativity/Real-world Connection (0–5) 5 4 5 3 Language Simplicity (0–5) 5 5 4 4 Average Score (out of 25) 25 21 22 16 Performance ⭐ Excellent 👍 Good 👍 Good ⚙️ Average 🧾 Evaluation Summary
ChatGPT produced the most comprehensive and human-like explanations, especially for experiential and universal prompts.

Claude provided context-rich, balanced responses, performing well for comparative and experiential prompts.

Gemini gave concise, factual answers, suitable for structured industrial reports.

Copilot was functional but limited, focusing more on technical summaries than descriptive content.
